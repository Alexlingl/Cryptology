# Cryptology
This is a project that helps you to encrpt and decrypt some information.

一、Funtion：

The project implements five encryption algorithms,include DES,affine,rc4,rsa,LFSR+JK.You can choose a file that need to be encryted and
choose a encryption algorithm to encrypt this file.After this file is encrypted,you also can choose the same encryption algorithm to decrypt
this ciphertext.
